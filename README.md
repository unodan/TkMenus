What is TkMenus?

TkMenus is a real time dynamically configurable menus module based on Tkinter. TkMenus is used for creating a menubar or popup context menus for your Tkinter applications. To create a menubar you just need to define it using standard python dictionaries. TkMenus reads and writes your configuration using json formatted files. Depending on the OS some features may not be available.

Sorry but currently there are no docs for this project, when time permits I will attend to it or if anyone would like to volunteer/contribute to this project that would be nice too! Although there are no docs it should not be to hard for anyone not new to Python to figure out what to do using the small example code in main.py.

Please leave any comments, bug reports, or features you would like added to danhuckson@hotmail.com
